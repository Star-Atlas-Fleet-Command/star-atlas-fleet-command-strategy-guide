## 🌌 What is Star Atlas?

Star Atlas is a blockchain-based space exploration and strategy MMO powered by Solana. Players command NFT starships, join factions, explore deep space, engage in missions, and earn ATLAS and POLIS tokens through logistics, trading, and combat.

## 🧠 What’s Inside This Guide

- ✅ Fleet deployment strategies for Faction Fleet & SCORE
- ✅ Fuel, ammo, food and repair logistics
- ✅ ATLAS earning mechanics & staking overview
- ✅ Choosing your faction (ONI, Ustur, MUD) wisely
- ✅ Marketplace guide: how to value ships and resources
- ✅ Bonus: Secret mission timing and daily fleet rotation

---

## 🧩 Core Mechanics

- 🛰️ Faction Fleet: Deploy ships to passive missions in SCORE
- 🚀 Ships: Vary in size, role (transport, fighter, cargo), and fuel burn
- 🪙 Tokens:
  - ATLAS: Utility token for rewards, purchases, fuel, resources
  - POLIS: Governance, DAO & in-game influence
- 🍖 Resources: Ships require food, ammo, fuel & toolkits (repairs)
- 🧭 Game Modules: SCORE (passive fleet), SAGE (on-chain movement), SCREAM (in development), DAO voting

---

## 🎯 Fleet Tips & Secrets

- ⛽ Fuel efficiency matters: Use Tier 1–2 ships for long-term passive income
- 💡 Stack ships in SCORE with overlapping resource timers to optimize supply cycles
- 🧠 ONI faction has long-term advantage in trade; MUD is best for early-game SCORE
- 🛠️ Keep toolkits on hand — repairs scale with ship class
- 📈 Watch markets on Magic Eden or Galactic Marketplace to flip fuel & ammo
